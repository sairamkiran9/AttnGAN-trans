## Realistic Image Synthesis with AttnGAN and Transformers
In this work, we implement a unique deep learning design and GAN formulation to bridge these advances in text and image modeling, translating visual ideas from characters to pixels. In this paper, we proposed a new architecture AttnGAN-trans by infusing different transformer networks with AttnGAN [6] and three of its variants AttnBERT, AttnXL, AttnGPT by infusing BERT, XLNet, GPT2 transformer networks respectively.

Soon, the complete work will be updated in this repo.
